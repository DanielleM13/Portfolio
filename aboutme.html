  <p> I'm 17 currently participating in Girls Who Code Summer Program. I come from a family of 5 including me but live with my dad, brother and half sister with our dog Sunny. Sunny is my world. I got her for my 14th birthday and she has been a blessing ever since. This year i got my first tattoo at a family tattoo party.    </p>
