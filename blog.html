<p>My idea of robotics has changed today. After experimenting with the robot, my interest for robotics increased. I find robotics super fun and would like to continue experimenting. Experimenting with robots makes me excited for the future of Robotics. My group and i work really well together because we each took turns working with the robot and connecting wires.</p>

  <p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard's work both had human characteristics in common. Myteam and i worked great on the lightshow. We each focused on a task making everything come together at the end. I think my team worked really well. The basic pices of an Arduino sketch is having pins, loops, and functions. </p>
